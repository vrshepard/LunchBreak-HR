            <p>TLDR; Yes, but do it in a magical way..
            </p>
            <p>I totally get it, times are tough and trying to get a job right now is nearly impossible unless you are
                the perfect candidate with all the right knowledge, skills, and abilities. Many people are still
                unemployed and the amount of jobs that are available are limited. Even more so for those of us that want
                to work from home, as specific skills required for remote work slim the available jobs down even more.
            </p>
            <p>And let’s face it, many of us still don’t feel comfortable going back into the office or being around
                people for that matter. (As a side note, the ability to work from home is something that should have
                been integrated into the workforce a long time ago. IMO this WFH mentality and implementation is a
                ‘late-bloomer’). So the chances that you will get a job seem bleak and makes you feel like ‘why try’?
                <strong>But what if you put on your resume that you do have all the knowledge, skills, and abilities?
                    Would that
                    put you at least in the running for a job? Are there any repercussions from a white lie or blatant
                    lie
                    on your resume? Would the company even find out?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Even though many companies are hiring, that doesn’t make up for the fact that <strong>thousands of people
                    can’t
                    land a job</strong>, let alone get through a company’s ATS system. In the HR/business world, ATS
                stands for
                Applicant Tracking System. I know it sounds scary, but nearly every company has a way to track all their
                candidates and the ‘system’ has an AI approach which eliminates candidates that it thinks are not
                qualified based on specific keywords listed in the resume and cover letter. On one hand, if you put
                those keywords in your resume, AI will let the recruiter see you applied. On the other, if the words are
                not there, the AI will kick you out with no questions asked. Which makes getting an interview that much
                harder, especially when you not only have other candidates to worry about, but now you have to first
                worry about your resume and application even getting to the recruiter’s eyes. </p>
            <p>Let’s face it, unless you are a ‘Mr. or Ms. Perfect Computer Robot,’ you likely won’t have 100% of the
                requirements anyway. And it feels like most companies need you to have at least 150% of the
                requirements. That means you need not only the ones listed on the job post, but all the ones that they
                choose not to list too. It feels impossible, and for most companies, they will never find that person
                without some compromise. It’s like trying to read someone’s mind and knowing exactly what the company
                wants, the recruiter wants, the hiring manager wants, and the team wants. UFF, what a list. But it’s not
                hopeless, believe me. </p>
            <p>So when you start to think about trying to get noticed, the first thing that comes into mind is to make
                sure that your resume will stand out from everyone else. I.E. adding creative bullet points on your
                resume that weirdly match what the company is looking for (this is the magic part). I mean, <strong>we
                    are
                    trying to get a job here</strong>. We have rent to pay and mouths to feed, who cares if 1 or 2
                bullet points are
                made up so that you can just get to the point where someone calls you. But that doesn’t always work out,
                or does it? </p>
            <p>Okay, let’s pretend for a moment that Lilly, a qualified candidate, is applying for a Project Manager
                position at a local insurance company. She sees that the job description has some very specific
                requirements about a specific software that the company utilizes called Breakdown Gillies (for the
                purposes of this example, this project management software is 100% made up). Lilly thinks, “I have 6
                years of experience with different types of software, but not Breakdown Gillies. But how much different
                can this software be from the ones I have interacted with in the past? I can use my previous company’s
                software, I am sure that I can use this one too.” Lilly decides to put on her resume that she has 6
                years of experience with Breakdown Gillies. Is she wrong for adding this on her resume?</p>
            <p><strong>Short answer</strong>: Yeah, this is not going to be good if she gets an interview. </p>
            <p><strong>Long answer</strong>: Not necessarily bad, but I would recommend that she revise her statement to
                read that she
                has 6 years using various project management software and include some examples of projects and which
                software that is most comparable to the company’s requirements and what they are looking for
                specifically. And possibly have a cover letter that demonstrates her use of the experience she has and
                how it can correlate to the company.</p>
            <p><strong>Here is the rub</strong>: When a company ‘requires’ a specific kind of knowledge, like this
                example with Breakdown
                Gillies, it is likely something that they can train in-house. From a company’s point of view, if they
                find the right candidate that fits what they are looking for, meshes well with the hiring manager, then
                they will likely be lenient with ‘requiring’ the experience of the Breakdown Gillies software.
                Especially since, in this example, Lilly has experience using other types of project management
                software, which means in a general sense, she can be trained to learn Breakdown Gillies. </p>
            <p>For argument’s sake let’s continue with the story. </p>
            <p>Lilly applied for the Project Manager position. Within 1 week she got an email to set up a phone
                interview with the company! AWESOME. <strong>That is what we wanted</strong>. We just want to talk with
                someone so we can
                tell them how wonderful we are and that they should hire us. Interview is set to happen in 2 days. (Let
                me know if you want another article on how to prepare for an interview). We get all our ducks in a row
                and patiently, eagerly, mind-numbingly wait for the day to come.</p>
            <p>Now we are at the interview and after the company asks a lot of behavior questions, they start with
                asking about project management software Breakdown Gillies on Lilly’s resume. This is what I would call
                the ‘oh shit’ moment for Lilly. Well Lilly, you are in a pickle my friend. </p>
            <p>In my mind you have 2 ways you can overcome this dilemma:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Keep on with the lie</strong>. However, this is not the choice I would necessarily recommend
                    for those with
                    very specific knowledge and skills. Sometimes there is no right way to get out of the lie, and to be
                    as vague as you can, may lead down a very slippery path. In some cases, it is impossible to trick
                    your way out of this one. If the company is asking about very specific knowledge and skills, it is
                    likely that they already know you are lying and you will be immediately disqualified from the
                    candidate pool, leaving you without a second glance and likely be flagged if you try to apply in the
                    future. Who wants an employee that will lie without admitting that they made a mistake? If somehow
                    you were able to get through and get an offer from the company, when your first day comes and you
                    show that you actually have no idea how to use Breakdown Gillies, you are in some deep poop my
                    friend. It is also entirely possible Breakdown Gillies (specific software that the company wants you
                    to use) was developed in-house, so they already know that it is VERY unlikely Lilly knows how to use
                    it. That’s why the better option is to:</li>
                <li><strong>Come clean</strong>. When they start to ask you about the software, tell them that you do
                    have 6 years of
                    experience using project management software, but after further review of the company’s
                    requirements, you made a mistake and have not used Breakdown Gillies in the past. However, you have
                    done some research on Breakdown Gillies and believe that you foresee no issue being able to learn
                    this software given some basic training. Maybe you even went as far as to take some training on this
                    software to prepare for the interview; did someone say YouTube? This tells the company that you
                    realized you messed up, you are being honest to correct your mistake, and have even gone as far as
                    to start to do some training on your own so that Day 1 won’t be as hard. Integrity and honesty are
                    some of the traits they will be looking for. This is a great way to prove that you can be relied on
                    to fix your mistakes. Because let’s be honest, we are human and we all make mistakes. It happens;
                    and when it does, come in with a game plan and fix it. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Obviously lying on your resume doesn’t always turn out good. The goal is to get a job that works well for
                your background and experience. If there is an aspect that could potentially match, but doesn’t quite
                fit, maybe call that out in a cover letter. I know that there is a lot of debate on whether cover
                letters have any purpose, and believe me when I say NO ONE wants to willingly write one, but I can
                assure you that many companies love to read them and it gives you a better chance at a phone call than
                applying to a job without one. (Let me know if you want another article on tips for writing a cover
                letter that puts you over the edge).</p>
            <p><strong>So I hate to ask, but what is the wiggle room for lying on your resume? It is a really common
                    thing for a
                    lot of people to do. So where do we draw that line?</strong></p>
            <p>It is okay to align your resume with the job posting, no one said any different. But when it comes to
                some specific skills and knowledge that are listed as a ‘requirement’ it may be better to add in a
                general bullet point, versus an outright lie. </p>
            <p>Yes, the goal is to get a job. However, if that means compromising on your integrity to get said job, do
                you really want to start your new working relationship based on lies? There can be so much more fallout
                trying to correct the lie, when maybe it is just not a good match to begin with.</p>
            <p><strong>What about changing your job title?</strong></p>
            <p>If your title is ‘Senior Engineer’ but you are performing the job duties of a manager and you have people
                reporting to you, then are you not a working manager? If you do the job without the title, does that
                make it any different? These are all great questions. And let me one to tell you that if you alter your
                title or job duties, there is nothing stopping the hiring company from performing a background check or
                even calling your current company to ask to speak with Joe Engineer Manager, not to mention your
                references or co-workers. I am not saying that is the most legal or ethical thing (in some states this
                is illegal, but that is on the recruiter to know their boundaries), but if the company is worried and
                wavering on their confidence in you as a candidate, then it is likely you won’t get the job anyway.
                Plus, who wants to work for a company that does illegal and unethical practices? Not you! We want a job
                that aligns with our core values, ethics, and aligns with our knowledge, skills, and abilities. And
                those are some giant red flags my friend.</p>
            <p>I hope this article was interesting and helpful. What do you think about lying on a resume to get an
                interview? Have you ever lied on your resume? If so, what happened? Do you think that companies should
                be more lenient about their requirements? Let me know what you think!</p>
            <p>Good luck with your job hunt,
