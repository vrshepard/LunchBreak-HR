            <h1>A Witty HR Blog, From Yours Truly</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Vicki. I am the content creator behind LunchbreakHR, and I have been writing and
                story-telling my whole life. With over 10 years as a professional leader in Human Resources and
                consulting, I bring a refreshing perspective on what it is like to lead employees to success while
                cultivating a workplace culture that they can be proud of. I have worked for some of the largest
                well-known global companies in the manufacturing space for most of my career, and have been consulting
                for leaders in a variety of industries including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial Services</li>
                <li>Technology</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Construction</li>
                <li>Retail</li>
                <li>Chemical</li>
                <li>Utilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I help leaders all over the U.S. to confidently engage their employees that produces actionable results
                that produces an innovative workplace culture that thrives. I absolutely love what I do and want to be
                able to share all my experiences and knowledge with you! That is why I created LunchbreakHR.</p>

            <h1>An HR Blog You Can Trust</h1>
            <p>My career started out in a most unconventional way and one that I will never forget: <em>I was fired
                    from my job</em> as a regional retail store manager of a woman’s clothing boutique. Before you
                are quick to judge on why I was fired, let me tell you that even if I could explain the details the
                reality is that I can’t. I have no idea why I was fired. I worked for the company for nearly 3 years
                and yet corporate made the executive decision to let me go. It was the most crushing, heart-breaking
                experience. You see, when I failed and dropped out of college, I put everything I had into working.
                So much of my time spent was rewarded by making the store one of top 5 leaders in the Midwest in
                sales and highest KPIs that the company had seen in years. </p>
            <h3>But Vicki, how does that make LunchbreakHR a blog I can trust?</h3>
            <p>I went back to school to understand business and how to effectively run a business. My ultimate goal
                was to understand why I was fired, but what I learned was more valuable than anything that you can
                simply read in a book. I returned to school for a Human Resource Management degree and found myself
                taking on two other majors, Economics and Women’s and Gender Studies. I loved taking all the classes
                to fully understand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What it means to cultivate an employee experience from hire to retire</li>
                <li>What it takes for leadership to effectively lead their employees</li>
                <li>Creating a culture of innovation and ideation</li>
                <li>Establishing policies and practices that keep the organization in compliance</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>And it doesn’t stop there</h3>
            <p>After 9 years of secondary education, I made valuable connections all over the world and in a
                multitude of industries. I also was mentored by one of the heads of the Economics department. These
                connections allowed me to be able to attend graduate school to attain a Masters in Human Resources
                and Labor Relations with a Certificate in Mediation and Negotiation. I bring my knowledge into the
                partnerships and connections daily. I have friends, peers, and collogues that ask for guidance and I
                am able to provide a perspective that leaves them able to action-plan their next steps without
                compromising their ability to remain competitive. </p>

            <h1>A Blog For Everyone</h1>
            <p>As both an employee and a leader my perspective can deliver real results to others. As a consultant
                and advisor, my passion for human resources and labor relations helps guide leaders to better
                understand their employees and be able to help create a culture of innovation and ideation. I work
                with leaders on a daily basis across the U.S. to help answer their questions on employee relations,
                feedback, coaching, strategy, recruiting, and retention. </p>
            <p>LunchbreakHR delivers topics from a wide array of disciplines that can have a dramatic effect on the
                industries that my clients work. I strive to include actionable results and workplace humor without
                compromising on integrity and agility. </p>

            <h3>The fine print…</h3>
            <p>Although LunchbreakHR is fun to read, we are not tax accountants or advisors. So when it comes to which
                boxes you should select on your paperwork, this won’t be the place for those answers. I am also not a
                lawyer, so whenever you have a situation that calls for a legal expert, I recommend that you find one
                you can trust.</p>
