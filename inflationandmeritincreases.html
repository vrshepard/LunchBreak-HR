            <p>Inflation has risen dramatically in the past year and has been reported to be over 8.3% at the end of
                August 2022. Many of your employees may be asking you if that means they’ll also be receiving an 8%
                increase. The short answer is no. It’s important to understand that inflation and wage growth are not
                one and the same. In fact, wage growth has historically out-paced inflation and we are simply in the
                reverse situation today.</p>
            <h3>So, what is inflation?</h3>
            <p>In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and
                services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and
                services;
                consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. Simply, inflation
                is the rate at which prices for goods and services increase. When prices of goods and services rise,
                that means that one unit of money will buy fewer goods and services than previously. This is called a
                loss of purchasing power, which can also impact the cost of living (however this is different from
                geographic differential). The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a
                nation’s money supply growth outpaces economic growth.</p>
            <h3>So, what is wage growth?</h3>
            <p>Wage growth is a rise of wages adjusted for inflation. In
                macroeconomics, wage
                growth is one of the main indications to measure economic growth for a long term, since is reflects the
                consumer’s purchasing power in the economy as well as the level of living standards.</p>
            <h3>How does inflation impact wage-growth? </h3>
            <p>As we continue to emerge out of the pandemic, we are still
                recovering from supply chain disruptions1 and the current war in the Ukraine2. And in conjunction with
                these challenges, the United States currently has a tight labor market and considerably low unemployment
                rate. With this unique environment, it is expected wage growth to also increase with inflation
                expectations being felt over a longer period of time and remaining elevated. These pressures are felt
                across every organization.</p>
            <h3>Tying it all together with 2023 Compensation Planning</h3>
            <p>Although merit increase budgets are increasing beyond levels in recent years and employees may be
                receiving larger increases than in previous years, it will not be at the same rate of inflation. Many
                organizations have simply tried to help employees understand the difference between wage growth and
                inflation, while others have opted to provide a nominal (most commonly 3%) increase or bonus as a
                gesture of goodwill to employees struggling with the consequences of inflation. </p>
